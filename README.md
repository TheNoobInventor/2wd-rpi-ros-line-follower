# 2 Wheeled Drive Raspberry Pi Line Follower running ROS1 Noetic
A 2-wheel drive car, controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4 running Robot Operating System (ROS1) Noetic, is used as a line following robot; it follows a black line against a white background, with the aid of a 5 channel infrared sensor.

(To be completed)

## Video demonstration

## Observations

Initial width of line was too thin, had to widen it using duck tape to enable the ir sensor to read the line well.
